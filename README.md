# ðŸ‘¤ Lokesh Patel â€” Professional Statement

I am a B.Tech Computer Science student at Lucknow University, currently pursuing a Minor in Artificial Intelligence from IIT Mandi. Alongside my academic curriculum, I have completed SQL & Database training from Udemy and have built a strong foundation in Data Structures using Java through Apna College.

I am also pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, where Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience with risk management, security audits, and incident response. I aim to combine my knowledge of AI and Cybersecurity to build secure, intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

My GitHub is a reflection of my journey â€” from Java DSA and SQL mini-projects to security assessments and automation scripts. I believe in learning by doing and am passionate about using technology to create solutions that are both innovative and secure.
